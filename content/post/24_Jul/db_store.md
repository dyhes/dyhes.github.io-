提代码的时候发现change里有两个名为.DB_Store文件，查了一下是什么东西，记录一下。

Content generated by GPT-4o:

The .DS_Store file is a hidden system file created by macOS (formerly Mac OS X) to store custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons, the choice of a background image, and other folder view options. The name stands for “Desktop Services Store.”

It is generally a good practice to add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file in Git repositories.
